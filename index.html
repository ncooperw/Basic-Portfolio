		<p>My coding career began as an accident. It was 1999, I was a scared young adult about to graduate from college with a degree in Psychology. During my last semester of college, I took a course in Teaching BioPsychology and my professor decided that the teaching focus of the course was going to be through an online learning platform. For my final project, I built an interactive web page for teaching about how the nose worked in tandem with the brain to give us a sense of smell. This was my first interaction with building anything on the internet and frankly, I still used dial-up at home. Little did I know that my future would take me in a roundabout way to a career of coding.</p>
  
		<p>I am presently a beginner at coding. I am extremely green and I believe this gives me an advantage.  I am flexible, eager to learn, and not afraid to make mistakes; all excellent qualities of a web developer. This portfolio contains the steps along my journey.</p>
